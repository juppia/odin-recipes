    <h2>Amazing salad!</h2>
    <p>A delicious Ukrainian beet salad! Great with meat and poultry dishes (especially Chicken Kyiv) with a side of mashed potatoes! The preparation takes some time, but I really like the salad! It is one of the few salads popular in Ukraine that doesn't contain mayonnaise! Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beets</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots</li>
        <li>1 pound potatoes</li>
        <li>2 large dill pickles, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can peas, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place the beets into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the carrots and potatoes. Boil for another 10 minutes, then cover the pot and leave overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The next day, peel and dice the beets, carrots, and potatoes into small, even pieces. Place the vegetables in a large bowl. Stir in the pickles, onion, peas, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Garnish with parsley before serving.</p>
